# Simple Sequencer

A simple online tool for creating music sequences.

**Status:** This project is **temporarily on hold**.

## Getting Started

The sequencer itself is fully web-based and requires no setup, simply click over to [hmi.dynu.net/simplesequencer](http://hmi.dynu.net/simplesequencer) and start placing notes.

(For MIDI playback, however, more setup may be required - see the MIDI section of this README.)
