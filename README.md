# Simple Sequencer

A simple online tool for creating music sequences.

**Status:** This project is **temporarily on hold**.

## Getting Started

The sequencer itself is fully web-based and requires no setup, simply click over to [hmi.dynu.net/simplesequencer](https://hmi.dynu.net/simplesequencer) and start placing notes.

### Midi Playback

Simple Sequencer uses the [MIDIAccess](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess) API for MIDI playback. Unfortunately, not all browsers support this yet, so please make sure you are using one of the supported browsers (as of Feb. 2022: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera).

You also need to make sure that you have a MIDI playback device connected or installed. For a free MIDI synthesizer you can install on your computer, check out [VirtualMIDISynth](https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth) - their site provides great instrucitons, as well as links to other things you might need, such as [soundfonts](https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth#soundfonts).

<!-- ## MIDI Troubleshooting

### My speakers are on, but there's no sound. What gives?

As a first step, please make sure you are using one of the supported browsers (which are, as of Feb. 2022: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera). Simple Sequencer uses the [MIDIAccess](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess) API for MIDI playback, and unfortunately not all browers support this yet. -->
